## A pnut.io hashtag listing

Being a very sociable social network, pnut.io’s predecessor App.net generated a number of groups spanning many interests.  Here are just a few of the regular things with potential to be carried forward; sorted by day and listed with hashtag, activity instigator, and a brief description.  Any active, clickable links are to the pnut.io live listing, whereas *italic entries* are not yet active.

| This document is not simply intended to provide a record of what once existed at App.net, a social network closed during early 2017.  For that see [a static App.net Wiki.](https://github.com/bazbt3/appdotnet_stuff/wiki)  **This** wiki’s documents are intended to be updated, shaped by popular demand. |

### Footnotes:

* Events occur weekly unless otherwise stated, however some challenges can run for the entire week.  Internet users in general live in many different timezones, so some events start as soon as the day begins [in the east](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Diomede) and terminate when the day ends [in the west.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Diomede_Island)  It’s important to note that no-one will hit you with a big stick for being early or late.
* This page starts the week on a Monday simply to conform to [ISO 8601.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
