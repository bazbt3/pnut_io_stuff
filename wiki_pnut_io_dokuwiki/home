| [**https://pnut.io**](https://pnut.io) is a social network created by @33MHz, one which borrows heavily from the nuts-and-bolts design of the now-defunct [App.net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App.net) *(Wikipedia)* social network. | [[https://github.com/bazbt3/pnut_io_stuff/blob/master/images/pnut_logo_brainseller.png|pnut.io logo by @brainseller]] |

At the time of writing this network is in open beta and requires an invitation before signing up.

### History:
It’s inevitable that comparisons to App.net will be made due to both the evolution of the basic infrastructure and the migration of users from the previous network.  However, App.net ceased operating at 2017-03-17T06:45Z.

For a perhaps more detailed historic perspective, there’s [my App.net Wiki.](https://github.com/bazbt3/appdotnet_stuff/wiki)

The strengths of that network, however small individually, are being built on at pnut.io; for example a willingness to engage with others of different beliefs, points of view; and the more sociable such as…

### Social:
* [[pnut.io Hashtags|ADN_hashtags]] - Hashtags associated with regular events, with states of mind…
  * [[#WednesdayChallenge|WednesdayChallenge]] - a weekly 1-post themed short story challenge.
  * [\#ThemeMonday](http://thememonday.bt3.com) - a monthly themed avatar change.
